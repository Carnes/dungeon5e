D&amp;D 5th Edition Dungeon Generator

I was attempting to make a random dungeon generator based on the official D&D DM guidebook. It is very faithful to the book but is largely unfinished.  Never got around to doing passages.  So some starting rooms which are supposed to only contain passages will generate as empty and go nowhere.

Even though you only see ascii, there is a whole connected object model in the background.  Text was just the easist way for me to focus on the business rules aspect.  In theory you could easily upgrade the display from ascii to images in a canvas element.  Similar in appearance to subsentient.

You can gen a few rooms to get a feel for how it works.  Running example: http://tageverything.org/github/dungeon5e/

Part of the code is pretty ugly and part of it is wonderful.  I contemplated a rewrite but doing TDD this time.  Only put down a few basic thoughts and got jasmin setup.  Maybe someday : )
