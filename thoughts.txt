Every section has x,y,z

Sections have base methods
    getMap
        originalMap
        connectedMaps
        openConnectionMap
    createConnection(door or passage or whatever), returns connection.  Only one opening allowed at a time.  Object returns map.  That map is used to find merge points.  Merge points are saved internally.
        connection.move(), chooses another merge point an removes previous merge point.  Returns false if no merge points remaining.
        connection.connect(), promotes to full connection
        connection.remove()

    getMatchingLocations

Map
    Handles x,y,z storage
    Handles tiles
    Handles rendering
